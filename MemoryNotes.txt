3 types of memory
Flash Memory
	- Fast
	issues:
	- Capacitors - charged to store data, but you don't discharge a byte of data, you discharge
					an entire bank at a time. you can only reset. 
	- impossible to write byte to flash you only write page to flash.
	- Erasing is slow - discharge compacitors and recharge them. 
		- inorder to be efficient - memory is being switched out to each block
			depending on how often it is being written in.
	- since flash is charging and discharging through capacitors they will eventually
		burn out.
	Partition
		
Platter
	- Slower than Flash, mechanical, they spin and a read/write head puts data
		on each platter. The head charges the data through a magnetic discharge on the metal. 
	- 
Network	
	- such as iSCSI
	
Each set of memory has blocks.
